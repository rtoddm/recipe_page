## Overview

This is a fairly simple project that I completed which allowed me to practice HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Media Queries. This website is a recipe card for an Omelete.

## My process

1. I began by initializing my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Then I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address (GitHub pages).
3. I looked through the designs in order to plan how I'd tackle the project. This step is important to help you think through potential CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. However, before worrying about any styles, I structured my HTML content.
5. I then wrote out the basic styles for my project such as `font-family` and `font-size`, etc.
6. Then I started adding CSS styles to the top of the page and worked down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project really helped me to better understand Mobile First development. I made the mistake of coding out the Desktop section first and then realize I should have started with the Mobile section first. That is a lesson I will not soon forget! This also drove home the importance of using sematic HTML tags and structuring your HTML accordingly.

### Continued development

Moving forward I plan on completing an additional responsive project utilizing HTML and CSS before moving on to a project which also incorporates JS.
